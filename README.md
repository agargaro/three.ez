**three.ez** is a TypeScript library designed to streamline and enhance the development of `three.js` applications. <br /> 
It provides a comprehensive suite of user-friendly tools and high-performance features, making it accessible even to beginners. <br />
With **three.ez**, you'll discover an efficient and robust toolkit for your 3D projects.

This library has only one dependency: `three.js r151+`.

## Key Features

| **Feature**                      | **Description**                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automatic Resize Handling**    | Automatically resizes the `Renderer`, `Camera`, and `EffectComposer`.                            |
|                                  | Using the `rendererResize` event, you can easily set the resolution for custom shaders.           |
| **Smart Rendering**              | Optimize performance by rendering frames only when necessary, reducing computational overhead.   |
| **Simplified Multiple Rendering**| Effortlessly manage rendering for multiple scenes or viewports within a single canvas.           |
| **Object3D Property Binding**    | Streamline the management of `Object3D` properties.                                                |
| **Event Programming**            | Add interactions to `Object3D` through programmable events, similar to `DOM events`.               |
|                                  | You can bind events for changes in position, scale, rotation, visibility, and enabled state.       |
| **Focus and Blur**               | Enhance interactivity with focus and blur events.                                                    |
| **Drag and Drop**                | Seamlessly integrate drag-and-drop functionality.                                                     |
| **Hitbox Functionality**         | Leverage hitboxes for customized intersections or simplified calculations.                            |
| **Raycasting Options**           | Choose between continuous or mouse movement-based raycasting, optimizing intersection operations.   |
| **Tweening**                     | Create smooth animations effortlessly with built-in tweening.                                        |
| **Simplified InstancedMesh**     | Manage `InstancedMesh` instances with the ease of working with `Object3D`, simplifying creation and manipulation. |

## Installation

You can install **three.ez** via npm using the following command:

```bash
npm install @three.ez/main
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { Scene, Mesh, BoxGeometry, MeshNormalMaterial } from 'three';
import { Main, PerspectiveCameraAuto } from '@three.ez/main';

const box = new Mesh(new BoxGeometry(0.1, 0.1, 0.1), new MeshNormalMaterial());
box.draggable = true;
box.on('animate', (e) => box.rotateX(e.delta).rotateY(e.delta * 2));
box.on(['pointerover', 'pointerout'], function (e) {
    this.tween('id').to(500, { scale: e.type === 'pointerover' ? 1.5 : 1 }, { easing: 'easeOutElastic' }).start();
});

const scene = new Scene().add(box);

const main = new Main();
main.createView({ scene, camera: new PerspectiveCameraAuto(70).translateZ(1) });
```
