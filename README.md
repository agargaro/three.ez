`three.ez` is a library designed to simplify the development of a `three.js` application, enabling the easy creation of reusable and maintainable components and providing a range of other functionalities.
It offers high performance on desktops and mobile devices.

## Features

### Automatic Resize Handling

Automatically resizes `Renderer`, `Camera`, `EffectComposer`. Using `rendererResize` event is also possibile to set resolution for custom shaders.

### Smart Rendering

Smart rendering allows a frame to render only when it is needed, which is particularly useful when using mostly static scenes, optimizing performance and reducing unnecessary computational overhead. <br>
It is based on a `Scene` property called `needsRender`, which is changed automatically when there is a change in position, scale, rotation, visiblity, focus, removal or addition of `Object3D``.
It is also possible to change it manually, in cases where changes are not automatically identified.

### Simplified Rendering

The rendering of viewports is handled by the `Main` class, using the `createView` method, which returns an instance of `RenderView`. <br>
By modifying the various properties of this instance, various parameters can be changed, including: the size, position, background, interaction state, and visibility. 
It is also possible to specify an `EffectComposer` for each RenderView to handle post-processing effects.

### Object3D Property Binding

It is possible to bind to a property of an `Object3D` the result of a callback, using the `bindProperty` method. <br>
The bindings are computed automatically during each animate cycle.
To manually compute the various bindings using the `setManualDetectionMode` and `detectChanges` methods.

### Event Programming

It facilitates interaction with `Object3D` by adding a series of programmable events. <br>
Interaction events work similarly to those in the DOM, having the same method of propagation.

  ```typescript
  /**
   * Represents events related to updates. These events do not propagate to parents.
   */
  export interface UpdateEvents {
    /** Event triggered when the position of the object changes. */
    positionchange: never;
    /** Event triggered when the scale of the object changes. */
    scalechange: never;

  /**

    /** Event triggered on first render and every time an object is rendered with a different viewport size from the previous one. */

    /** Event triggered when a pointer enters the target. */
    pointerover: PointerEventExt<T, R>;
    /** Event triggered when a pointer enters the target (no propagation). */

    /** Event triggered on the focused object when a key is released. */

    dragenter: DragEventExt<T, RD>;
    /**
     * Event triggered when a draggable object moves over the drop target.
     * Triggers every frame if the scene has 'continousRaycastingDropTarget' equal to true.
     */
    dragover: DragEventExt<T, RD>;
    /** Event triggered when a draggable object leaves a drop target. */
    dragleave: DragEventExt<T, RD>;
    /** Event triggered when a draggable object is dropped onto a drop target. */
    drop: DragEventExt<T, RD>;
  }
  ```
</details>

### Focus and Blur

Implements focus handling and related events to handle certain interactions more easily. <br>
By setting the value of the `focusable` property of an `Object3D` you can determine whether it can receive focus.

### Drag and Drop

Implements drag and drop handling and related events by adding two properties to each `Object3D`:
- `draggable`: makes an object draggable.
- `findDropTarget`: determines whether intersections with drop targets will be checked during dragging.

The drag can be cancelled by pressing 'Esc'.

### Hitbox Functionality

Hitboxes can be used to handle a different intersection area or to simplify intersection calculations. 

### Raycasting Options

It is possible to choose between continuous raycasting (every frame) or raycasting only during mouse movement, providing the flexibility to optimise raycasting operations according to application requirements. <br>
In addition, it is possible to choose which objects can be intersected, setting `interceptByRaycaster` property.

### Tweening

Implements smooth animations effortlessly with built-in tweening functionality. `Vector3`, `Euler`, `Quaternion`, `Color` are supported.

### Simplified InstancedMesh

With the class `InstancedMesh2` it is possible to handle each sub-entity of an `InstancedMesh` as if it were an `Object3D`. This makes development much simpler and more intuitive.

## How It Works

The `Main` class handles rendering, resizing, events and all other functionality. <br>
In addition, methods and properties have been added to the `Object3D` and `Scene` classes.

## Installation

You can install `three.ez` via npm using the following command:

```bash
npm install @three.ez/main
```

## Usage

Example of a simple animated and draggable box:

```typescript
import { Scene as SceneBase, Mesh, BoxGeometry, MeshNormalMaterial } from 'three';
import { Main as MainBase, PerspectiveCameraAuto } from '@three.ez/main';

class DraggableBox extends Mesh {
  constructor() {
    super(new BoxGeometry(0.2, 0.2, 0.2), new MeshNormalMaterial());
    this.draggable = true;
    this.on('animate', (e) => this.rotateX(e.delta).rotateY(e.delta * 2));
  }
}

class Scene extends SceneBase {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.add(new DraggableBox());
  }
}

class Main extends MainBase {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.createView({ scene: new Scene(), camera: new PerspectiveCameraAuto(70).translateZ(1) });
  }
}

const main = new Main();
```

<details>
  <summary>Show smaller version</summary>

  ```typescript
  import { Scene, Mesh, BoxGeometry, MeshNormalMaterial } from 'three';
  import { Main, PerspectiveCameraAuto } from '@three.ez/main';

  const box = new Mesh(new BoxGeometry(0.2, 0.2, 0.2), new MeshNormalMaterial());
  box.draggable = true;
  box.on('animate', (e) => box.rotateX(e.delta).rotateY(e.delta * 2));
  const scene = new Scene().add(box);
  const main = new Main();
  main.createView({ scene, camera: new PerspectiveCameraAuto(70).translateZ(1) });
  ```
</details>

## Override Typescript Type Definition

To extend the definitions of `three`, go into `ts.config` and add this path:

```javascript
"compilerOptions": {
  "paths": {
    "three": ["./node_modules/@three.ez/main/types"]
  }
}
```

## Live Examples

These examples use `vite` and some mobile devices may go out of memory. 
There is one example without vite.
