# Multiple Rendering

In order to render multiple distinct views, you'll need to create multiple instances of `RenderView`.

```typescript
const viewA = main.createView({ scene: sceneA, camera: cameraA });
const viewB = main.createView({ scene: sceneB, camera: cameraB, visible: false });
```

## Managing View Visibility

You have the option to manually control the visibility of a view by adjusting the `visible` property as follows:

```typescript
viewB.visible = true;
```

However, the recommended approach is to assign one or more tags to each view and use the `setActiveViewsByTag` method of the `Main` object.

```typescript
main.createView({ scene, camera: frontCamera, tags: ['front'] });

main.createView({ scene, camera: backCamera, tags: ['back'] });

main.createView({ scene, camera: frontCamera,
  viewport: { left: 0, bottom: 0, width: 0.5, height: 1 },
  tags: ['multiple']
});

main.createView({ scene, camera: backCamera, 
  viewport: { left: 0.5, bottom: 0, width: 0.5, height: 1 },
  tags: ['multiple']
});

main.setActiveViewsByTag('multiple'); // Show 'multiple' views and hide 'front' and 'back' views
```

This approach provides a more organized and efficient way to control the visibility of multiple views within your application.

> ⚠️ **Warning** <br />
> Please exercise caution to prevent overlapping multiple views when managing their visibility.
