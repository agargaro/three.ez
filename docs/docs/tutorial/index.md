## Key Features

### Automatic Resize Handling
Automatically resizes the `Renderer`, `Camera`, and `EffectComposer`. <br />
Using the `viewportResize` event, you can easily set the resolution for custom shaders.

### Smart Rendering
Optimize performance by rendering frames only when necessary, reducing computational overhead.

### Simplified Multiple Rendering
Effortlessly manage rendering for multiple scenes or viewports within a single canvas.

### Object3D Property Binding
Streamline the management of `Object3D` properties.

### Event Programming
Add interactions to `Object3D` through programmable events, similar to `DOM events`. <br />
You can bind events for changes in position, scale, rotation, visibility, and enabled state.

### Focus and Blur
Enhance interactivity with focus and blur events.

### Drag and Drop
Seamlessly integrate drag-and-drop functionality.

### Hitbox Functionality
Leverage hitboxes for customized intersections or simplified calculations.

### Raycasting Options
Choose between continuous or mouse movement-based raycasting, optimizing intersection operations.

### Tweening
Create smooth animations effortlessly with built-in tweening.

### Simplified InstancedMesh
Manage `InstancedMesh` instances with the ease of working with `Object3D`, simplifying creation and manipulation.

## Asset Management
Efficiently load and manage external assets and resources for your 3D projects.
